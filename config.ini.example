[devices]
# Device mappings: short_name = hostname_or_ip
# Example:
# router1 = 192.168.1.1
# switch1 = switch.example.com
# firewall = 10.0.0.1
#
# Cloud/virtual nodes (unmanaged devices like ISP routers):
# Use the "cloud:" prefix for devices not in LibreNMS
# ISP = cloud:ISP_Gateway
# Internet = cloud:Internet
#
# Pseudo nodes (for one-to-many link scenarios):
# Use the "pseudo:" prefix for junction points that aggregate traffic
# ISP_Junction = pseudo:ISP_Access_Point

[links]
# Link definitions: linkX = device1:port1 -- device2:port2
# Example:
# link1 = router1:eth0 -- switch1:GigabitEthernet0/1
# link2 = switch1:GigabitEthernet0/2 -- firewall:eth1
#
# Cloud node links (utilization derived from managed device's interface):
# link3 = router1:eth-wan -- ISP:wan
#
# Pseudo node links (for one-to-several scenarios):
# Multiple managed devices can link to the same pseudo node.
# Traffic at the pseudo node is aggregated from all connected interfaces.
# Use case: Single ISP port serving multiple internal routers
# link4 = router1:eth-wan -- ISP_Junction:virt-port1
# link5 = router2:eth-wan -- ISP_Junction:virt-port2

[positions]
# Device positions on the map (automatically managed by editor)
# Format: device_x and device_y coordinates
# Example:
# router1_x = 100
# router1_y = 100
